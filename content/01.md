# Introduction {#intro}

This is how you do bullets:

- bullet 1
- bullet 2
- bullet 3

This is how you do a link:

My [Homepage](www.thomaskieffer.com)

This is how you reference a chapter.

As previously discussed in [Chapter 1](#intro), ...

Inline Math: 
$\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x – y – xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}$

This is an image:

![A Cat Using a PC \label{fig:cat_pc}](images/cat.jpg)

This is how you reference the picture:

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cat_pc}, this amazing feline breed is using a PC made for humans.

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” [@dune1990]


```{caption="A great example of the famous HelloWorld" frame=single label=lst:codeSnippet .java}  
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

As seen in the code example [Hello World](#lst:codeSnippet)

This is a table:

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines. \label{my_table}

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.

Of course you can also reference your Table \ref{my_table}.

## Motivation

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

## Scope of this Thesis

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
